#In this project, I am querying a database consisting of IMDB Movies data to answer questions about the data.

#1. How many movies in the database are in the "Horror" genre?
SELECT count(*)
FROM "IMDB_top_1000"
WHERE genre="Horror";

#2. Show all the movies that were released after the year 2000.
SELECT * FROM "IMDB_top_1000"
WHERE release_year > 2000;

#3. List all movies in alphabetical order.
SELECT title
FROM "IMDB_top_1000"
ORDER BY title asc;

#4. What is the oldest crime movie in the database, and what year was it made?
SELECT title, release year
FROM "IMDB_top_1000"
WHERE genre="Drama"
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 1;

#5. List all the movies that have a runtime of less than 120 minutes, and a metascore rating of higher than 90.
SELECT * FROM "IMDB_top_1000"
WHERE runtime < 120
AND metascore > 90;
