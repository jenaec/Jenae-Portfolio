#For this project, I downloaded Goodreads data from Kaggle.
#Next, I created a table to insert the data into.
#Last, I performed analystics on the data using SQL.

#To create the table:
CREATE TABLE books
(
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
title VARCHAR(30),
author_name VARCHAR(30),
average_rating DECIMAL(3, 2) NOT NULL
number_of_pages INTEGER NOT NULL,
publisher VARCHAR(30),
ratings_count INTEGER NOT NULL,
);

#Then I inserted the Goodreads data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL

#First, I determind the average rating, number of pages, and ratings count

SELECT
author_name,
title,
,avg(average_rating)
,avg(number_of_pages)
,avg(ratings_count)

FROM books
GROUP BY author_name, title

#Then I determined the who the top 5 highest rated authors on Goodreads were
SELECT title, author_name, average_rating
FROM books
ORDER BY average rating
LIMIT 5
